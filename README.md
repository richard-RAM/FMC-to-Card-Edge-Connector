# FMC-to-Card-Edge-Connector-Passive-Level-Shifting-Board

This repository contains an 88 channel conversion board designed to interface an 88-pin probe card with a Virtex-7 VC707 FPGA via an FMC cable. Additional level shifting was required to lower the FPGAs 1.8V logic to 1.2V for 52 signals. Simple voltage dividers were chosen for this purpose.
